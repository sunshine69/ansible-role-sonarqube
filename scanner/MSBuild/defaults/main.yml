# It is best to download manually the file and put it into our bitbucket
# install storage so we have a working version tested. If upgrade then repeat
# the process to be sure everything is tested and we leave a rollback way for
# us.

# That site list two version and we only download the dotnetcore version as it
# can run across OS.

# The scanner needs to be match with the server as well, check the version carefully.

# The server that this agent scanner will talk to
sonar_host_url: https://sonar.xvt.technology

# The sonar install dir will have that version. Thus if you upgrade to the new
# version you need to change the bamboo build plan in bamboo - the bamboo
# variable sonar_scanner_msbuild_version to match up with what you set in here.

# Each version of the scanner will live in its own version number set by this
# variable. To test the upgrade you can manually create that under the current
# running bamboo agent and then unzip them. Then set the bamboo variable
# sonar_scanner_msbuild_version with the new one and test. You can roll back
# the same way.
